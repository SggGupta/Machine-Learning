Fraud Detection in near Real-time

Businesses are facing critical problems due to the growth of nancial fraud. Banking, insurance and tax revenue industries are losing billions of dollars due to fraudulent transactions every year. Currently fraud detection systems chase fraudulent transactions which have already completed. Due to tremendous growth of web based applications, the volume of online transactions are growing enormously. Data mining techniques along with big data processing systems are the best solutions for detecting fraud on large volumes of data in real time. This paper presents a review of the literature found in the Ô¨Åeld of fraud detection using various data mining techniques. This review shows that supervised machine learning algorithms like Natural Network, Bayesian Network and Random Forest are extensively used in fraud detection applications. Less research was conducted in the detecting fraud in real time using more advance data mining techniques along with big data stream processing frameworks. There is a need of fraud detection applications which can help to stop fraud in near real time.
